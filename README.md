# TelecomChurn
The project is based on Indian and Southeast Asian market where mostly prepaid payment model is prevelant In this project we will use the usage-based chrun definition i.e. customers who have not done any usage either incoming or outgoing in terms of calls, internet etc. over a period of time. We focus only the High Value customers, as typically 80% of the revenue comes from top 20% of the customers The dataset spans data of four consecutive months between June - September. The objective is to predict the churn in the last month using the data from the first three months. There are typically three phases of a customer lifecycle - (a) Good Phase where the customer is happy with services. We have assumed month 6 and 7 as Good Phase period here.(b) Action Phase where customer experience starts to sore. We have assumed the 3rd month i.e. month 8 here for this (c) Churn Phase where the customer is said to have churned. This is equivalent to the month 9 here.
